- Finish making the Reservation and Reagent autoated forms 
- Redo the form templates (seperate forms for admins, teachers, and students [levels of authorization])

Abit:
- Finish form edits and additions through admin boxes
- Summary page froms 

Michel:
- Calendar

- limit dates that can be selected on the form to the max school year

- Are the list of the teachers in the form alphabetical?

Later into the future:
- Add prisma-backup
- Notification system
- Add terms and conditions to each (signatures auto sign and admins can use it to make e-records)

Extra not super important:
- Add other common forms to download for convenience
