Some Random Notes:
- Add materials
- Combine materials and equipment to the new forms
- Add materials to the saving sequence

- Control Code Prefix (A-#)
- Finish creating and downloading pdf

- limit dates that can be selected on the form to the max school year
- Redo the form templates (seperate forms for admins, teachers, and students [levels of authorization])

- Fix signature signing
- Table to view the lab requests
- Admin UI to change any values

- Are the list of the teachers in the form alphabetical?

Later into the future:
- Add prisma-backup
- Notification system
- Add terms and conditions to each (signatures auto sign and admins can use it to make e-records)

Extra not super important:
- Add other common forms to download for convenience
